# Task 06 - Beginner Control Structures - For Loop

This program uses a for loop to print a series of asterisks, where the number of asterisks increases line by line.

## Objective: Ascending Asterisks Display

The program performs the following:

1. Iterates over a range of numbers (1 through 5) using a for loop.
1. In each iteration, it prints an ascending number of asterisks based on the current count.

The Python script that accomplishes this can be found in the file: [for_loop.py](https://github.com/G-o-r-a-n/Learning-Python/blob/d1da622498296c9a2c7cd2eb027865afe0fbbd2a/Task%2006%20-%20Beginner%20Control%20Structures%20-%20For%20Loop/for_loop.py).
