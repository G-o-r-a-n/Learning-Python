# Task 09 - Beginner Data Structures - Lists and Dictionaries

This Python script simulates a cafe stock valuation system. It involves the use of fundamental Python data structures like lists and dictionaries.

## Objective:

The objectives of this task are to:

1. Construct a list `menu` that contains at least 4 items available in the cafe.
1. Build a dictionary `stock` that incorporates the stock value for each item on the menu.
1. Create another dictionary `price` that stores the prices for each item on the menu.
1. Calculate the `total_stock` worth in the cafe. This requires looping through the appropriate dictionaries and lists.
1. Print out the result of the `total_stock` calculation.

The Python script that accomplishes this can be found in the file: [lists_dictionaries_cafe_stock.py](https://github.com/G-o-r-a-n/Learning-Python/blob/main/Task%2009%20-%20Beginner%20Data%20Structures%20-%20Lists%20and%20Dictionaries/lists_dictionaries_cafe_stock.py).

## Code Explained:

The script follows these steps:

- **Menu and Stock Initialisation**: The script starts by initialising the menu list, and stock and price dictionaries. These serve as the basic data structures holding our cafe data.
- **Calculation**: Then, for every item on the menu, the script calculates the total value of that item (quantity times price) and adds it to the total stock worth.
- **Display**: Lastly, the script prints out the total stock value of the cafe.

## Usage:

To utilise this script, execute the Python file in your terminal. It calculates and prints the total value of items in stock based on the prices and quantity of items available.

```
python lists_dictionaries_cafe_stock.py
```

### Note:

This script is part of a task series aiming to develop proficiency with Python's basic data structures like lists and dictionaries. It showcases their usage in a simple, real-world simulation of managing cafe stock.
