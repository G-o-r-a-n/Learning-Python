# Task 05 - Beginner Control Structures - While Loop

This program continually requests user input of numerical data and calculates the mean average of the entered numbers when the user decides to stop.

## Objective: Mean Average Calculator

The program performs the following:

1. Continually prompts the user to enter a number.
1. Stops requesting user input when the user enters -1.
1. Calculates and displays the average of the numbers entered, excluding -1.

This task makes use of a while loop repetition structure for input collection and uses exception handling to validate user input.

The Python script that accomplishes this can be found in the file: [while_loop.py](https://github.com/G-o-r-a-n/Learning-Python/blob/main/Task%2005%20-%20Beginner%20Control%20Structures%20-%20While%20Loop/while_loop.py
