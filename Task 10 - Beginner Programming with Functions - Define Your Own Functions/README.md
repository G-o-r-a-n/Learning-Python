# Task 10 - Beginner Programming with Functions - Define Your Own Functions

This Python script is designed to estimate the total cost of a holiday for a user. It involves the usage of user input and the creation of custom functions in Python.

## Objective:

The objectives of this task are to:

1. Gather user input on three aspects:
    - `city_flight`: The destination city for their flight.
    - `num_nights`: The number of nights they will be staying at a hotel.
    - `rental_days`: The number of days that they will be hiring a car.
1. Define four functions:
    - `hotel_cost`: Returns the total cost of the hotel stay based on the number of nights.
    - `plane_cost`: Returns the cost of the flight based on the destination city.
    - `car_rental_cost`: Returns the total cost of the car rental based on the number of rental days.
    - `holiday_cost`: Calculates and returns the total holiday cost by calling the three functions above.
1. Print out all the details about the holiday in a readable format.

## Code Explained:

The script executes the following steps:

- **Gather User Input**: The script begins by asking the user for their destination city, hotel stay duration, and car rental period.
- **Define and Call Functions**: Next, it defines and calls four functions that calculate the cost of the hotel, plane, car rental, and total holiday, based on the user's input.
- **Print Results**: Lastly, it prints a cost breakdown, detailing the cost of each element of the holiday and the total cost, formatted neatly for readability.

The Python script that accomplishes this can be found in the file: [functions_holiday_calculator.py](https://github.com/G-o-r-a-n/Learning-Python/blob/main/Task%2010%20-%20Beginner%20Programming%20with%20Functions%20-%20Define%20Your%20Own%20Functions/functions_holiday_calculator.py)

## Usage:

To use this script, run the Python file in your terminal and follow the prompts. You will be asked for your destination city, hotel stay duration, and car rental period, and the script will return a cost breakdown of your holiday.

```
python functions_holiday_calculator.py
```

### Note:

This script is part of a task series aimed at developing proficiency in defining and using custom functions in Python. It provides a simple, practical example of how functions can be used to modularise code, improve code readability, and avoid code repetition.
