# Learning Python and Data Science

Hello! I'm an aspiring Software Developer who recently graduated from a HyperionDev Data Science bootcamp in the top 0.5% of the cohort. The bootcamp was predominantly in Python, making use of Jupyter notebooks and libraries such as NumPy, MatPlotLib, SciKit-Learn, SpaCy, and Pandas. I also have some experience in HTML/CSS.

This repository documents my journey learning Python and Data Science, from writing my first simple programs to building complex projects. Each directory in this repository corresponds to a different task or project that I've completed.

(Note: Replace "username" with your actual GitHub username in the URLs above)

Each directory contains the Python scripts I wrote for that task, along with a README file that provides additional context and explains what I learned from the task.

## Future Plans

I'm currently planning to expand my knowledge in SQL, Flask, and JavaScript. Beyond that, I aim to learn Django, TensorFlow, and R.

## About Me

I'm passionate about coding, data analysis, and machine learning. I created this repository to document my learning journey and share my progress with others. Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or comments!
