# Task 02 - The String Data Type

This task is divided into two objectives:

## Objective 1: Strip Method

The goal of this part of the task was to write a Python program that:

- Declares a variable `hero` that contains the string value `$$$Superman$$$`
- Uses the string manipulation method `strip()` to remove the dollar sign characters from the string
- Prints the modified string

The code for this objective can be found in the file: [strip_method.py](https://github.com/G-o-r-a-n/Learning-Python/blob/07e9457df263121389fd4047b7c713bb518edccd/Task%2002%20-%20The%20String%20Data%20Type/strip_method.py).

## Objective 2: Replace Method

The goal of this part of the task was to write a Python program that:

- Saves a sentence with exclamation marks as a single string
- Uses the `replace()` function to replace each exclamation mark with a blank space
- Uses the `upper()` function to convert the modified sentence to uppercase
- Prints the sentence in reverse

The code for this objective can be found in the file: [replace_method.py](https://github.com/G-o-r-a-n/Learning-Python/blob/07e9457df263121389fd4047b7c713bb518edccd/Task%2002%20-%20The%20String%20Data%20Type/replace_method.py).
