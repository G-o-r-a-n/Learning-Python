# Task 03 - Beginner Control Structures - The Boolean Data type and if, else, and elif statements

This task had one objective:

## Objective: Full Name Validation

The goal of this task was to write a Python program that:

- Asks the user to input their full name
- Validates the input to ensure that the user has entered a full name. The program should display an appropriate error message if they haven’t.

Validation rules:

1. If the user hasn’t entered anything, display: "You haven’t entered anything. Please enter your full name."
1. If the user has entered less than 4 characters, display: "You have entered less than 4 characters. Please make sure that you have entered your name and surname."
1. If the user has entered more than 35 characters, display: "You have entered more than 35 characters. Please make sure that you have only entered your full name."
1. If the user input is valid, display: "Thank you for entering your name."
