# Task 01 - Your First Computer Program, and Using Variables

This task is divided into two objectives:

## Objective 1: Hello, World!

The goal of this part of the task was to write a Python program that:

- Asks for a user's name with `input()`
- Prints out the user's name
- Asks for a user's age with `input()`
- Prints out the user's age
- Prints the string "Hello World!" on a new line

The code for this objective can be found in the file: [hello_world.py](https://github.com/G-o-r-a-n/Learning-Python/blob/f0d48e0662bb4b7b5c6ad618e40eaa2d6b0cb715/Task%2001%20-%20Your%20First%20Computer%20Program%2C%20and%20Using%20Variables/hello_world.py).

## Objective 2: Menu Selection

The goal of this part of the task was to write a Python program that:

- Provides a menu to the user
- Asks the user to select their three favorite food items from the menu
- Stores the selections in the variables `item1`, `item2`, and `item3`
- Prints each item separately

The code for this objective can be found in the file: [menu.py](https://github.com/G-o-r-a-n/Learning-Python/blob/f0d48e0662bb4b7b5c6ad618e40eaa2d6b0cb715/Task%2001%20-%20Your%20First%20Computer%20Program%2C%20and%20Using%20Variables/menu.py).
