# Task 04 - Logical Programming - Operators

This program calculates and determines the award a participant will receive in a triathlon based on their total completion time.

## Objective: Triathlon Award Determination

The goal of this task was to write a Python program that:

1. Asks the user to input the completion time (in minutes) for each of the three events in a triathlon: swimming, cycling, and running.
1. Calculates the total time taken to complete the triathlon.
1. Determines and displays the award a participant will receive, based on the total time. The awarding system is as follows:
    - Within qualifying time of 100 minutes = Gold Code Conqueror
    - Within 5 minutes of qualifying time = Silver Commit Champion
    - Within 10 minutes of qualifying time = Bronze Push Pioneer
    - More than 10 minutes of qualifying time = No award
